I created this app for my Usable Privacy and Security class' final project. The reason we created the app was to hsow what a game as a password could look like. The game I recreated was Battleship, in it you can place ships in any order you want and any direction you want in order to create your password. It's only a prototype so for instance the submit button doesn't do anything but it allows you to see what a game could be like for a password.
