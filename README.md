We at team Thesys think that normal passwords are not user-friendly and are boring. They’re not very secure if they’re memorable and they’re not very usable if they are secure, so you’re stuck in a bad or bad scenario. So we devised a solution. We think that using games for your password is a lot better. What we built is a prototype to show what games for passwords could look like. They’re a lot easier to remember and are a lot more secure. 

We built two prototypes, an Adobe XD prototype showing off the games Scrabble and Battleship and an Android app (this repository) which allows you to play with Battleship to make the app.

This is a project that I made for my Usable Privacy and Security class.
